ðŸ“ˆ IRIS VISUALIZATION PROJECT SUMMARY
------------------------------------
Total Samples: 150
Number of Species: 3
Species List: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica

Observations:
1. Setosa species are clearly separable in scatter plots.
2. Petal length and petal width show strong correlation (~0.96).
3. Boxplots reveal Setosa has much smaller petal dimensions.
4. Feature distributions are mostly normal, except for petal width skew.
5. 3D and scatter matrix visuals highlight clear clustering between species.

All plots have been saved in the folder: C:\Users\LOQ\Desktop\Ai ml\AI-ML-Learning-Journey\Matplotlib_foundations\Mini_project\Project_output/
