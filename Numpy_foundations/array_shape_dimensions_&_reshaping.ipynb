    "\n",
    "In NumPy, every array has an internal structure defined by **its shape and number of dimensions**. This structure determines how data is stored, accessed, and processed — and it becomes especially important when working on **AI/ML tasks**, where the data must match strict model input shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`.shape`**: A tuple showing the size along each axis. For example, `(3, 2)` means 3 rows and 2 columns.\n",
    "- **`.ndim`**: The number of axes (or dimensions). A scalar has `ndim=0`, a 1D array has `ndim=1`, and so on.\n",
    "- **`.size`**: Total number of elements in the array (product of all shape values).\n",

    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy, understanding array shape, dimensions, and reshaping is fundamental for any data science or AI/ML workflow. Every array has a `.shape` that defines its structure (like rows and columns), an `.ndim` that tells us how many dimensions (or axes) it has, and a `.size` which tells us the total number of elements. These attributes help us manage and manipulate data precisely. The `.reshape()` method allows us to change the structure of an array without changing its data, as long as the total number of elements remains the same. This is especially important in machine learning, where model input requirements are strict — for example, image data might need reshaping from `(28, 28)` to `(784,)`, or adding batch dimensions like `(batch, features)` or `(batch, height, width, channels)` for deep learning models. We can also use `-1` in `.reshape()` to let NumPy automatically calculate the correct dimension, which is very handy when preprocessing large datasets. Reshaping is not just about format — it’s about ensuring compatibility with AI models and enabling efficient computation. Overall, mastering `.shape`, `.ndim`, and `.reshape()` is essential for building clean, bug-free, and production-ready machine learning pipelines."
