    "**Import and Initial Data Setup:** This section imports the NumPy library, which is essential for numerical computing in Python. NumPy provides powerful array operations and mathematical functions. The program creates three separate arrays representing student scores in different subjects: math, science, and English. Each array contains 5 scores corresponding to 5 different students. The `np.array()` function converts Python lists into NumPy arrays, which are more efficient for numerical operations and provide vectorized computing capabilities. This foundational step establishes the core data structure that will be manipulated throughout the program."

This function takes the individual arrays and stacks them as columns, creating a matrix where each row represents a student and each column represents a subject. The resulting `student_scores` array has dimensions of 5×3 (5 students, 3 subjects), providing a structured format for analyzing student performance across multiple subjects. This transformation makes it easier to perform operations on the entire dataset and enables more sophisticated data analysis techniques."

This operation is useful for certain statistical calculations or when you need to process all data points uniformly without regard to their original structure.

These statistics provide valuable insights into subject difficulty, student performance distribution, and consistency across different academic areas."

Both methods ensure data persistence across program sessions."
