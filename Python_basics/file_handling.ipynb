    "# What is File Handling?\n",
    "\n",
    "File handling in Python allows us to **read from** and **write to files** stored on our computer or server.  This is essential for working with datasets, saving model outputs, logging results, and processing large amounts of data outside of our program’s memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AI/ML, file handling is everywhere: from loading training data in `.txt` or `.csv` files, to saving model predictions or checkpoints. We will often interact with raw data stored in files, clean or transform it, then save our results for later use or sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides simple and powerful built-in functions to open files in different modes (read, write, append, etc.), process them line-by-line or in bulk, and close them safely to avoid data loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering these basics prepares you to handle more complex tasks later, like working with structured data using Pandas, handling JSON files from APIs, or saving binary files like model weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| `'r'` | Read (default) |\n",
    "| `'w'` | Write (overwrite existing) |\n",
    "| `'a'` | Append (add to file end) |\n",
    "| `'x'` | Create new file (error if exists) |\n",
    "| `'rb'` | Read binary |\n",
    "| `'wb'` | Write binary |\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Handling Concepts & Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open a file:** The built-in `open()` function is used to open a file. It requires at least the filename and optionally the mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'r'` for reading (default mode)\n",
    "- `'w'` for writing (creates a new file or truncates existing)\n",
    "- `'a'` for appending\n",
    "- `'x'` for exclusive creation (fails if file exists)"
